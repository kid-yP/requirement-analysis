# 📋 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

In every software development project, proper requirements analysis is **vital for successful deployment**. This repository outlines the key components of the requirement analysis process in a software project.

---

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is a **crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where requirements are gathered, analyzed, and defined to shape the final software product.

---

## ✅ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

It helps to:
- Clarify and understand stakeholder needs
- Define the scope of the project clearly (preventing scope creep)
- Provide a solid foundation for design and development
- Estimate cost, time, and resources more accurately

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Interviews, surveys, and workshops to collect stakeholder input

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping to refine requirements

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Structured documentation using specifications, user stories, and use cases

- **Requirement Analysis & Modeling:**  
  Visual models to represent and analyze requirements

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Review requirements with stakeholders and define acceptance criteria

## 🔧 Types of Requirements

### 🧩 Functional Requirements
These define *what* the system should do:
- **Hotel Management Service** – Management of hotel-related information/services
- **Customer Service (Search & Booking)** – Users search and book hotels
- **Booking History** – Customers view current and past bookings

### ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
These define *how* the system should perform:
- **Performance & Reliability** – CDN + Message Queues ensure speed and content delivery
- **Usability** – Display of relevant offers and hotel suggestions
- **Scalability** – Database management and data archiving to handle growth
- **Caching (Performance)** – Redis integration for fast, efficient data access

## 🧭 Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams visualize how users interact with the system. Actors such as **Guests** and **Admins** engage with key system functions such as **Searching** and **Booking**.

### 📌 Benefits:
- Clear representation of system functionality
- Helps organize and identify system requirements
- Facilitates communication among stakeholders and the dev team

## 📌 Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define what qualifies as *"Done"* in a task or feature. They ensure quality control and stakeholder alignment.

**Example:**  
> In the booking checkout process, users must select arrival and departure dates via a drop-down calendar. The selected dates should appear on the reservation page and the confirmation email.
