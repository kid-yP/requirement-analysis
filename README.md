# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the complete Requirement Analysis phase of a Booking Management System. The goal is to demonstrate how to identify, define, and structure software requirements in a professional and scalable way.

This is a practical exercise in applying industry-standard techniques including:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case diagrams
- Acceptance criteria
- Requirement validation

The final output will serve as a comprehensive blueprint for developers and stakeholders alike.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the earliest and most critical stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), serving as a blueprint for what the software should achieve and how it should behave.

The process ensures that the project team fully understands what the users and business stakeholders want, which reduces misunderstandings and costly rework later in the project.

Effective requirement analysis involves:
- Engaging with users and stakeholders to elicit detailed needs
- Defining what the system should do (functional requirements)
- Clarifying non-functional aspects like performance, usability, and security
- Validating and prioritizing requirements to align with business goals

By translating stakeholder needs into clear, actionable documentation, Requirement Analysis lays the foundation for successful software design and implementation.
